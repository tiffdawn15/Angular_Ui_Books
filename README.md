# Angular_Ui_Books
Angular web appication to display the books that I read in 2023 for the 50 book challenge.

# MVP: 
Angular table that connects to the Java book api. 

# Requirments
For local development you will need both this repo and the [book_api](https://github.com/tiffdawn15/book_api).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
